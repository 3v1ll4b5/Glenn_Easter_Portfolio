Structured applied study of vulnerability mechanics through controlled lab environments.

## Current Focus: Web Application Security & Pentesting Path

I am intentionally working through Web Application Security modules to deepen my understanding of how common vulnerability classes emerge within real systems.

The purpose is not exploitation proficiency, but architectural literacy.

Web application vulnerabilities often stem from:

- Broken trust boundaries
- Insufficient input validation
- Improper authentication or session controls
- Business logic design flaws
- Logging and monitoring gaps

Studying these mechanisms strengthens my ability to:

- Interpret scan results within context
- Design detection logic around observable telemetry
- Understand how vulnerabilities propagate operational risk
- Improve automation guardrails within structured analysis frameworks (e.g., Project G.I.R.)

Each lab is documented through a defensive lens — focusing on root cause, detection signals, remediation strategy, and governance implications rather than exploit mechanics.
