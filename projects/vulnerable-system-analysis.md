# Vulnerable System Analysis Reports

*Technical assessments of authorized lab targets.*

## **Coming Soon**

This repository will contain assessment reports for systems I have personally audited in my home lab (e.g., Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop). These reports allow me to practice the skills of a Vulnerability Analyst: identifying flaws, verifying them without damage, and recommending fixes.

*Note: All analyses are conducted in an isolated virtual network.*
