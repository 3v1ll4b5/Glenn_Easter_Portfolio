# Incident Handling Methodologies

*Documenting my study and application of Incident Response (IR) frameworks.*

---

## **Coming Soon**

This section will house my notes and simulated incident reports based on the **NIST SP 800-61** Computer Security Incident Handling Guide and the **SANS PICERL** framework. My goal is to demonstrate my understanding of the full lifecycle of a security incident, from preparation to post-incident activity.

### Template for Future Entries

#### Simulation: [Scenario Name, e.g., Phishing Campaign Analysis]
**Framework Applied:** NIST / SANS

**1. Preparation:**
*What baseline protections were in place? What tools were ready?*

**2. Detection & Analysis:**
*What triggered the alert? How was the scope determined? (e.g., Log analysis steps)*

**3. Containment, Eradication, & Recovery:**
*Strategy for stopping the spread. Steps to remove the threat. Verification of system restore.*

**4. Post-Incident Activity:**
*Lessons learned. What would be done differently next time?*
