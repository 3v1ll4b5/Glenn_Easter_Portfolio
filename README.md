## Executive Profile

I am a cybersecurity practitioner in development with a focused interest in defensive security operations, detection engineering, and responsible automation design.

Currently completing the Merit America Cybersecurity Program, I am building structured technical depth in incident response, vulnerability assessment, network analysis, and SQL-based telemetry investigation. My work emphasizes not only identifying technical findings, but interpreting them within operational and business context.

I approach security as a systems discipline. Tools generate output — security professionals generate judgment. As automation and AI continue to scale security operations, I am particularly interested in how guardrails, human-in-the-loop validation, and risk contextualization can prevent automation from becoming ungoverned amplification.

All hands-on work is performed in controlled, authorized lab environments.

## Core Technical Domains

### Security Operations & Incident Response
- Log correlation and anomaly detection
- Vulnerability triage and remediation prioritization
- Incident lifecycle modeling (NIST / SANS frameworks)
- Post-incident analysis and lessons-learned documentation

### Detection Engineering & Data Analysis
- SQL-driven log querying and threshold tuning
- Event aggregation and time-bucketing strategies
- Translating threat hypotheses into measurable detection logic
- Reducing false positives through contextual filtering

### Networking & Systems Foundations
- TCP/IP protocol analysis
- Port and service enumeration in lab environments
- Linux command-line investigation workflows
- Traffic inspection using packet analysis tools

### Responsible Automation & Governance
- Human-in-the-loop validation checkpoints
- Scope enforcement and authorization boundaries
- Non-destructive defaults in testing environments
- Risk-context scoring instead of blind execution

## Independent Research & Applied Practice

### Project G.I.R. (Glitch, Intrude, Repeat)

Project G.I.R. is a modular defensive analysis framework I designed to structure hands-on experimentation in a safe, controlled lab environment.

The framework simulates a vulnerability detection pipeline:

1. Controlled scan orchestration  
2. Contextual interpretation of findings  
3. Risk scoring based on impact and exposure  
4. Structured, human-readable reporting  

The emphasis is not exploitation. The emphasis is disciplined interpretation.

As AI-assisted security tooling becomes more common, Project G.I.R. serves as a practical exploration of how automation must remain accountable to human judgment. Guardrails are embedded at the architectural level to prevent scope creep and unauthorized execution.

## Professional Direction

### Short-Term
- Contribute to a security operations team in a SOC or junior analyst capacity
- Continue strengthening detection logic, investigation workflows, and defensive tooling literacy

### Long-Term
- Help shape the responsible integration of AI and automation into defensive security operations
- Develop expertise in incident response and detection architecture
- Contribute to frameworks that balance scalable tooling with ethical oversight

## Operating Principles

- Authorization before action  
- Context before conclusion  
- Remediation before recognition  
- Automation with discipline
