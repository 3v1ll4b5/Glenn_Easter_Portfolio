## Professional Summary

I am an aspiring cybersecurity analyst currently transitioning into the field through the rigorous Merit America Cybersecurity Program. My background is built on a foundation of disciplined learning, and I am actively developing hands-on skills in incident response, log analysis, vulnerability assessment, network fundamentals, and SQL for data analysis. I approach security with a "defense-first" mindset, focusing on understanding systems to better protect them. I am committed to continuous growth, ethical practice, and applying structured frameworks to solve complex security challenges. Through independent projects and formal training, I am bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

## Independent Learning & Applied Practice

I believe that the best way to learn security is to build, analyze, and defend systems in a controlled environment.

### [Project G.I.R. (Glitch, Intrude, Repeat)](projects/project-gir.md)
*Concept & Architecture*
A personal, modular learning framework designed to simulate vulnerability detection and response in a safe, authorized laboratory environment. This project focuses on understanding the "why" and "how" of security flaws to prevent them, emphasizing strict ethical boundaries and human-in-the-loop decision-making.
