## Executive Profile

I am a cybersecurity practitioner in development with a focused interest in defensive security operations, detection engineering, and responsible automation governance.

Currently completing the Merit America Cybersecurity Program, I am building structured capability in incident response, vulnerability analysis, network fundamentals, and SQL-driven log investigation. My approach emphasizes disciplined interpretation over tool dependency — understanding not only what a system reports, but what it means, why it matters, and how it should be addressed.

As security tooling increasingly incorporates automation and AI, I am particularly interested in preserving the human judgment layer that prevents automation from becoming uncontrolled amplification.

All experimentation is conducted in isolated, authorized lab environments.

## Core Technical Domains

### Security Operations & Incident Response
- Structured incident lifecycle modeling (NIST / SANS)
- Log correlation and anomaly identification
- Vulnerability triage with remediation prioritization
- Post-incident reflection and documentation

### Detection Engineering & Data Analysis
- SQL-based query construction for security telemetry
- Time-window aggregation and threshold tuning
- Translating threat hypotheses into measurable detection logic
- Contextual filtering to reduce false positives

### Networking & Systems Foundations
- TCP/IP protocol analysis
- Port and service interpretation
- Linux command-line investigative workflows
- Defensive scanning in controlled lab environments

### Responsible Automation & Governance
- Human-in-the-loop validation checkpoints
- Scope enforcement and authorization guardrails
- Non-destructive testing defaults
- Risk contextualization before action

## Independent Research & Applied Practice

### Project G.I.R. (Glitch, Intrude, Repeat)

Project G.I.R. is a disciplined interpretation framework designed to teach structured vulnerability analysis in a controlled environment.

Rather than focusing on exploitation mechanics, the framework emphasizes:

- Slowing down tool output into structured reasoning  
- Converting raw findings into contextual risk understanding  
- Forcing human review before escalation  
- Practicing remediation-first thinking  

The purpose of G.I.R. is educational by design. It exists to train judgment, not automate decisions.

As AI-assisted security tooling continues to evolve, this project explores how systems can support analysts without replacing critical thinking. Guardrails are embedded architecturally to ensure authorization, scope discipline, and ethical boundaries remain intact.

## Security & AI Philosophy

Security automation is accelerating, and AI-assisted tooling is increasingly embedded in detection, response, and vulnerability management workflows. While these technologies increase scale and speed, they also introduce amplification risk — small errors can propagate quickly when decision layers are abstracted away.

My philosophy is that automation should enhance clarity, not replace judgment.

Effective security systems must include:

- Transparent reasoning paths  
- Explicit authorization boundaries  
- Human validation checkpoints  
- Context-aware risk interpretation  

The future of defensive security will depend not only on better models, but on better governance frameworks surrounding those models. I am particularly interested in designing systems where AI assists analysts without diminishing accountability, traceability, or ethical oversight.

## Professional Direction

### Short-Term
- Contribute to a security operations team in a SOC or analyst role
- Continue strengthening investigative reasoning and detection workflows

### Long-Term
- Contribute to the responsible integration of AI into defensive security operations
- Develop expertise in detection architecture and incident response strategy
- Advocate for governance frameworks that preserve human judgment in automated systems

## Operating Principles

- Authorization before action  
- Context before conclusion  
- Remediation before recognition  
- Automation with discipline
