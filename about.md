# About Me

## Career Transition Narrative

My journey into cybersecurity is driven by a desire to protect critical infrastructure and a fascination with how complex systems function. I am building toward cybersecurity leadership deliberately. My development is structured around technical depth, decision discipline, and ethical accountability. Formal training through **Merit America** provides the framework; independent applied work ensures the judgment layer is continuously strengthened.

I chose cybersecurity because it sits at the intersection of problem-solving, continuous evolution, and public service. The challenge of staying ahead of emerging threats while ensuring the stability and safety of digital environments is a career path that resonates with my long-term professional values.

## Growth Mindset & Learning Philosophy

I view cybersecurity not just as a job, but as a discipline that requires constant study. My approach to learning is structured and deliberate:
1.  **Fundational Knowledge:** Mastering the basics of networking and operating systems.
2.  **Practical Application:** Applying theory in safe, controlled lab environments (like my Project G.I.R. initiative).
3.  **Reflective Practice:** Documenting what I learn to ensure deep understanding and retention.

Security demands humility at scale. I approach problems with structured skepticism, evidence-driven validation, and a commitment to continuous refinement rather than premature certainty.

## Ethical Framework

Integrity is non-negotiable in this field. My work is guided by the following principles:
-   **Authorization First:** I never interact with a system without explicit permission or ownership.
-   **Do No Harm:** My goal is to improve security posture, not to disrupt services.
-   **Privacy & Confidentiality:** I respect data privacy and handle sensitive information with the utmost care.

## Professional Goals

**Short-Term:**
-   Complete the Merit America program with distinction.
-   Obtain entry-level certification (e.g., CompTIA Security+, Google Cybersecurity Certificate).
-   Secure a role as a Junior SOC Analyst or IT Support Specialist with a security focus.

**Long-Term:**
-   Develop specialized expertise in Incident Response and Threat Hunting.
-   Contribute to the security community through mentorship and knowledge sharing.
-   Become a trusted advisor in defensive security operations.
