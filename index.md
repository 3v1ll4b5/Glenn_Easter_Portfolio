## Executive Profile

I am a cybersecurity practitioner in development focused on defensive security operations, detection engineering, and responsible automation governance.

Currently completing the Merit America Cybersecurity Program, I am strengthening practical capability in incident response, vulnerability analysis, network fundamentals, and SQL-based telemetry investigation. My approach centers on disciplined interpretation — understanding not just what tools report, but what findings mean, why they matter, and how they should be addressed.

As automation and AI increasingly scale security workflows, preserving structured human judgment becomes critical. My work emphasizes governance, contextual risk assessment, and guardrails that ensure automation supports — rather than replaces — accountable decision-making.

All experimentation is conducted in isolated, authorized lab environments.
